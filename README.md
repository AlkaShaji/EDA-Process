# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects  

This repository contains multiple **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tasks** performed on different datasets.  
The goal of these projects is to practice **data preprocessing, visualization, and insights generation** for real-world datasets.  

---

## 🔎 **Task 1 – Titanic Dataset (Survival Analysis)**  
- Explored passenger demographics (Age, Gender, Pclass, Fare).  
- Handled missing values using imputation strategies.  
- Visualized distributions of age, fare, and survival status.  
- Analyzed survival rate by **class, gender, and family presence**.  
- Created advanced visualizations including **FacetGrid** and **Pairplot**.  
- **Key Insight:** Women and children in higher classes had a better chance of survival.  

---

## 🔎 **Task 2 – Stock Market Dataset (all_stocks_5yr.csv)**  
- Preprocessed stock market data (Date, Closing Price, Volume).  
- Converted time columns to datetime format for time series analysis.  
- Handled missing values and anomalies in price data.  
- Distribution analysis of stock returns and volatility.  
- Correlation analysis between different companies’ stock movements.  
- **Key Insight:** Stocks of similar sectors showed strong correlations.  

---

## 🔎 **Task 3 – Global Population & Country Dataset**  
- Columns included `UID`, `iso2`, `iso3`, `Country_Region`, `Province_State`, `Lat`, `Long_`, `Population`.  
- Handled missing values by dropping less relevant fields and imputing population.  
- Distribution analysis of **population, latitude, and longitude**.  
- Correlation heatmap between numerical fields.  
- Top 10 countries by population visualized using bar charts.  
- Geographic scatter plot created with **Lat vs Long (bubble size = population)**.  
- **Key Insight:** Population is highly skewed, concentrated in countries like China, India, and the US.  

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis  

---

## 📌 **Highlights**  
- Learned and applied **EDA best practices** across multiple datasets.  
- Covered **data cleaning, missing value handling, statistical analysis, and visual storytelling**.  
- Built **reusable EDA workflow** for quick analysis of new datasets.  

---

✨ This repo demonstrates the **end-to-end EDA process** across diverse datasets – survival data, stock market data, and global demographic data.
